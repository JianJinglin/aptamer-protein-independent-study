# Independent Study: Aptamer-protein interaction

# Project Repository

Welcome to our project repo. This space is used for code sharing and collaboration.

## Shared Resources

- **Code Repository**: You're currently viewing it.
- **Shared Folder**: For gathering final result files (e.g., hdock.out files and final Excel files for wk3-4), please use [this Google Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eraY7pbQy4Uo33GSwMmUAgf2pTyNLxYS?usp=drive_link).

## Project Timeline

| Week | Date | Tasks |
|------|------|-------|
| wk3-wk4 | 9/13-9/22 | T0: read the background and pipeline illustration, and understand what's your todos. <br> T1: read the code I provided in "WK3" folder and try one new sequence you randomly create to make the pipeline run! <br> T2: massively repeat the process to generate more than 1000 pairs for each protein (You may need to create functions to achieve this).|

*Note: Tasks will be updated as the project progresses.*

## Getting Started

1. Read this readme file and the "0912_Framework for Independent Study.pdf" in this repo.
2. Follow the task description in pdf. For WK3-WK4, your final goal is to successfully run the pipeline and upload two hdock.out with one results file (Excel) in the Google folder.
