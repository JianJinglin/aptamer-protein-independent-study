- **Shared Folder**: For gathering final result files (e.g., hdock.out files and final Excel files for wk3-4), please use [this Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfFbKa1EJXjUej9CEFCLFRBD9JPUyrNlawCveFGuFYYlzbN3g/viewform).

## Project Timeline

| Week | Date | Tasks |
|------|------|-------|
| wk3-wk4 | 9/13-9/22 | T0: read the background and pipeline illustration, and understand what's your todos. <br> T1: read the code I provided in "WK3" folder and try one new sequence you randomly create to make the pipeline run! <br> T2: massively repeat the process to generate more than 1000 pairs for each protein. (You may have to create some functions to repeat the process.)|

*Note: Tasks will be updated as the project progresses.*
